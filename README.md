This project provides a web application, Revue Crafters, and a requirements specification. The primary objective of the project is to verify the App functions meet the specified requirements and to detect discrepancies between existing conditions and required conditions. This involves creating test cases for each of the use cases. It also includes the detection and detailed documentation of any identified errors (software bugs). All the work is documented in the provided Test Management and Bug Tracker file.
